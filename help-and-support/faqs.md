# Frequently asked questions

## Can I apply the password filtering to only a specified group of users?
Unfortunately not. The password filter applies to all users in the domain. A future version of Lithnet Password Protection is planned which will implement fine-grained password policies.

## Can users be shown a more informative message about why their password was rejected?
Windows does not provide a native mechanism to report the reason why a password change was rejected.
